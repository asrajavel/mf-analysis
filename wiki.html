        <h3>Meaning of a point in various graphs that are plotted</h3>

        <br> These descriptions below assume that you have a basic understanding of returns and XIRR beforehand.
        <br> Investment duration of 3 yrs is taken for all examples.
        <br> p is the value of the point on 10-Jan-2023.
        <br> Below is the meaning of p for all graphs.
        <br>
        <br> <h4>Sip Rolling Returns (XIRR %):</h4>
        You invested x amount on each of: 10-Jan-2020, 10-Feb-2020, 20-Mar-2020....until 10-Dec-2022
        <br> Totally making 12*3 = 36 investments
        <br> x can be anything, but the same amount x is invested everytime.
        <br> p is the XIRR return percentage of your investment.
        <br> So this graph will show you all possible returns(XIRR) this fund generated, if you did a 3 yr SIP.
        <br> That is the meaning of rolling returns - a graph where all points are return values.
        <br>
        <br> <h4>Sip Rolling Absolute Value (₹):</h4>
        You invested x amount on each of: 10-Jan-2020, 10-Feb-2020, 20-Mar-2020....until 10-Dec-2022
        <br> x is what you input in the text box as monthly SIP amount.
        <br> Totally making 12*3 = 36 investments
        <br> p is the current value(₹) of your investment
        <br> So this graph will show you all possible absolute returns(₹) this fund generated, if you did a 3 yr SIP
        anytime.
        <br> This graph can tell you all possible final investment values this fund had generated in the past, if you do
        a blind SIP of say ₹10,000 in this fund.
        <br>
        <br> <h4>Lumpsum Rolling Returns (CAGR %):</h4>
        You invested x amount on 10-Jan-2020.
        <br> x can be anything.
        <br> p is the yearly return(%) of you investment
        <br>
        <br> <h4>Lumpsum Rolling Absolute Value (₹):</h4>
        You invested x amount on 10-Jan-2020.
        <br> x is what you input in the text box as the lumpsum amount.
        <br> p is the current value(₹) of your investment
        <br>
        <br> <h4>Standard Deviation Rolling Annualized Monthly (Risk) (%):</h4>
        We take all the monthly returns for all the dates from 10-Jan-2020 to 10-Jan-2023.
        <br> (Monthly return of 10-Jan-2023 is the return percentage of the same date compared to 10-Dec-2022)
        <br> p is the standard deviation of these monthly returns, multiplied by sqrt(12) to make it annualized.(<a href="https://ycharts.com/glossary/terms/standard_deviation">Why?</a>)
        <br> This is a measure of how much the returns fluctuated, which is a measure of risk.

        <h3>Where is data sourced from</h3>
        <br> <h4>Index</h4>
        Currently there are no sources in India which provides historical index data through API.
        <br> I manually download from <a href="https://www.niftyindices.com/reports/historical-data">https://www.niftyindices.com/reports/historical-data</a>
        using a python script and upload into <a href="https://github.com/asrajavel/mf-index-data/tree/main/index%20data">another repo</a>.
        <br> I will try to update this every few months.
        <br> In case you need newer data for indices, consider using the corresponding index funds(keep in mind tracking errors).
        <br>
        <br> <h4>Mutual funds</h4>
        Every time you choose a fund, live data is fetched from <a href="https://mfapi.in/">mfapi.in</a>
        <br> This data is always up-to-date.

        <h3>How are the calculations done</h3>
        <br> There are no backend servers to this site, nothing leaves your browser.
        <br> Once you select a mutual fund or index, XIRR is calculated for all the supported investment durations
        (currently 1, 3, 5, 10 years), for both lumpsum and SIP investments.
        <br> (Nifty 50 index data is available from 1999, for all durations with Lumpsum and SIP rolling XIRR calcs -> a
        total of around 60,000 XIRR values need to be calculated)
        <br> Given the nav data - this takes around 2 mins for one fund/index, as the xirr calculations are time taking.
        <br> Which is too much to wait for a graph to load, also the browser will freeze as all the calculations will be
        done on your device.
        <br> To avoid this, a set of precalculated values for XIRR are stored in the website which avoids xirr calc on
        your device, hence skipping the 2 mins.
        <br> The size of the precalculated values is around 3MB, which is loaded to the page itself.
        <br> Everytime you open/refresh the site this 3MB is loaded again.
        <br>
        <br> Calculating rolling standard deviation is also a CPU intensive time taking operation.
        <br> So the variance is calculated in a rolling fashion, based on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14635735/how-to-efficiently-calculate-a-moving-standard-deviation/14638138#14638138">this implementation</a>.

        <h3>Known Issues</h3>
        <br> All the logic is in the js files.
        <br> Browsers cache the js files, so when some js file contents are changed, the js files are not reloaded sometimes.
        <br> Hard refresh the page to reload the js files.
